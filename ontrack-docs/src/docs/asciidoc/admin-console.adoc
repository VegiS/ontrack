=== Administration console

The _Administration console_ is available to the _Administrators_ only and is
accessed through the user menu.

It allows an administrator to:

* manage the running [jobs](Architecture: jobs)
* manage the error messages
* see the state of the external connections
* see the list of <<extending,extensions>>

[[admin-console-jobs]]
==== Managing running jobs

The list of all <<architecture-jobs,registered jobs>> is visible to the
administrator. From there, you can see:

* general informations about the jobs: name, description
* the run statistics

[[admin-console-jobs-filter]]
===== Filtering the jobs

The following filters are available:

* status
  * _idle jobs_: jobs which are scheduled, but not running right now
  * _running jobs_: jobs which are currently running
  * _paused jobs_: jobs which are normally scheduled but which have been paused
  * _disabled jobs_: jobs which are currently disabled
  * _invalid jobs_: jobs which have been marked as invalid by the system
    (because their context is no longer applicable for example)
* category and type of the job
* error status - jobs whose last run raised an error
* description - filtering using a search token on the job description

[[admin-console-jobs-control]]
===== Controlling the jobs

For one job, you can:

* force it to run now, if not already running or disabled
* pause it if it is a scheduled job
* resume it if it was paused
* remove it if it is an invalid job

You can also pause or resume all the jobs using the _Actions_ menu. All jobs
currently selected through the filter will be impacted.

The same _Actions_ menu allows also to clear the current filter and to display
all the jobs.
