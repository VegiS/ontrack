==== Extending event types

Extensions can define additional event types which can then be used to add custom events to entities.

To register a custom event type:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
public static final EventType CUSTOM_TYPE = SimpleEventType.of("custom-type", "My custom event");
public MyExtension(..., EventFactory eventFactory) {
   super(extensionFeature);
   eventFactory.register(CUSTOM_TYPE);
}
----

Then, you can use it this way when you want to attach an event to, let's say, a build:

[source,java]
----
EventPostService eventPostService;
Build build;
...
eventPostService.post(
    Event.of(MyExtension.CUSTOM_TYPE).withBuild(build).get()
);
----
