=== Branch templates

In a context where branches are numerous, because the workflow you're working
with implies the creation of many branches (feature branches, release branches,
...), each of them associated with its own pipeline, creating the branches by
hand, even by cloning or copying them would be too much an effort.

Ontrack gives the possibility to create _branch templates_ and to automatically
create branches using this template according to a list of branches. This list
of branches can either be static or provided by the SCM.

[[templates-definition]]
==== Template Definition

We distinguish between:

* the *branch template definition* - which defines a template for a group of
  branches
* the *branch template instances* - which are branches based on a template
  definition

There can be several template definitions per project, each with its own set
of template instances.

A *template definition* is a branch:

* which is disabled (not visible by default)
* which has a special decoration for quick identification in the list of
  branches for a project
* which has a list of template parameters:
  * names
  * description

whose descriptions and property values use `${name}` expressions where name is
a template parameter.

One can create a template definition from any branch following those rules:

* the user must be authorized to manage branch templates for a project
* the branch must not be already a _template instance_
* the branch must not have any existing build

[[templates-instance]]
==== Template Instances

A *template instance* is also a branch:

* which is linked to a <<templates-definition,template definition>>
* which has a set of name/values linked to the template parameters
* which has a special decoration for quick identification in the list of
  branches for a project
* it is a "normal branch" as far as the rest of Ontrack is concerned, but:
** it cannot be edited
** no property can be edited not deleted (they are linked to the template definition)

There are several ways to create template instances:

* from a definition, we can create one instance by providing:
** a name for the instance
** values for each template parameters
* we can define template synchronization settings linked to a template
  definition:
** source of instance names - this is an extension point. This can be:
*** a list of names
*** a list of actual branches from a SCM, optionally filtered. The SCM
    information is taken from the project definition.
** an interval of synchronization (manual or every x minutes)
*** a list of template expressions for each template parameter which define
    how to map an instance name into an actual parameter value (see below)

The actual creation of the instance is done using cloning and copy technics
already in place in Ontrack. The replacement is done using the template
parameters and their values (computed or not).

The manual creation of an instance follows the same rules than the creation of
a branch. If the branch already exists, an error is thrown.

For automatic synchronization from a list of names (static or from a SCM):

* if a previously linked branch does not exist any longer, it is disabled
  (or deleted directly, according to some additional settings for the
  synchronization)
* if a branch already exists with the same name, but is not a template instance,
  a warning is emitted
* if a branch exists already, its descriptions and property values are synched
  again
* if a branch does not exist, it is created as usual

Reporting about the synchronization (like syncs, errors and warnings) are
visible in the _Events_ section, in the template definition or in the template
instances.

The same synchronization principle applies to branch components: promotion
levels, validation stamps and properties.

Finally, at a higher level, cloning a project would also clone the template
definitions (not the instances).

[[templates-expressions]]
==== Template expressions

Those expressions are defined for the synchronization between template
definitions and template instances. They bind a parameter name and a branch
name to an actual parameter value.

A template expression is a string that contains references to the branch name
using the `${...}` construct where the content is a Groovy expression where
the `branchName` variable is bound to the branch name.

Note that those Groovy expression are executed in a _sand box_ that prevent malicious code execution.

===== Examples

In a SVN context, we can bind the branch SVN configuration (branch location +
tag pattern) this way, using simple replacements:

	branchLocation: branchName -> /project/branches/${branchName}
	tagPattern:     branchName -> /project/tags/{build:${branchName}*}

In a Jenkins context, we can bind the job name for a branch:

	jobName: branchName -> PROJECT_${branchName.toUpperCase()}_BUILD
