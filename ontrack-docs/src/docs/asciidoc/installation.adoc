[[installation]]
== Installation

There are several ways to install Ontrack.

[[installation-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

Ontrack has been tested on different Linux variants (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS)
and should also work on Windows.

Ontrack relies on at least a JDK 8 build 25. More recent versions of the JDK8
are OK. However, no test has been done yet using early JDK 9 versions.

Ontrack runs fine with 512 Mb of memory. However, think of upgrading to 2 Gb of
memory if you intend to host a lot of projects. See the different installation
modes (Docker, RPM, etc.) to know how to setup the memory settings.

Ontrack stores its data in a local H2 database. This one can grow up to 500 Mb
for big volumes (hundreds of projects).

[[installation-docker]]
=== Installing using Docker

Ontrack is distributed as a Docker image on the https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub], as `nemerosa/ontrack:{ontrack-version}`.

[[installation-docker-overview]]
==== Overview

The Ontrack image exposes the ports `443` and `8080`.

Two volumes are defined:

* `/var/ontrack/data` - contains the data for Ontrack (files & database) but also the log files. This is typically provided through a data volume container.
* `/var/ontrack/conf` - contains the configuration files for Ontrack (see later).

[[installation-docker-basic]]
==== Basic deployment

You can start Ontrack as a container and a shared database and configuration on the host using:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --detach \
   --publish=8080:8080 \
   --volume=/var/ontrack/data:/var/ontrack/data \
   --volume=/var/ontrack/conf:/var/ontrack/conf \
   nemerosa/ontrack
----

The <<configuration,configuration files>> for Ontrack can be put on the host in
`/var/ontrack/conf` and the database and working files will be available
in `/var/ontrack/data`. The application will be available on port `8080` of
the host.

Java options, like memory settings, can be passed to the Docker container using
the `JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
   ...
   --env "JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m" \
   ...
----

[[installation-rpm]]
=== RPM installation

You can install Ontrack using a RPM file you can download from the
https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/releases[releases] page.

The RPM is continuously tested on CentOS 6.7 and CentOS 7.1.

To install Ontrack:

[source,bash]
----
rpm -i ontrack.rpm
----

The following directories are created:

|===
| Directory | Description

| `/opt/ontrack` | Binaries and scripts
| `/usr/lib/ontrack` | Working and <<configuration,configuration>> directory
| `/var/log/ontrack` | Logging directory
|===

You can optionally create an `application.yml` configuration file in
`/usr/lib/ontrack`. For example, to customise the port Ontrack is running on:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 9080
----

Ontrack is installed as a service using `/etc/init.d/ontrack`.

[source,bash]
----
# Starting Ontrack
service ontrack start
# Status of Ontrack
service ontrack status
# Stopping Ontrack
service ontrack stop
----

To upgrade Ontrack:

[source,bash]
----
# Stopping Ontrack
sudo service ontrack stop
# Updating
sudo rpm --upgrade ontrack.rpm
# Starting Ontrack
sudo service ontrack start
----

The optional `/etc/default/ontrack` file can be used to define the
`JAVA_OPTIONS`, for example:

[source]
./etc/default/ontrack
----
JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m
----

[[installation-debian]]
=== Debian installation

You can install Ontrack using a Debian file (`.deb`) you can download from the
https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/releases[releases] page.

To install Ontrack:

[source,bash]
----
dpkg -i ontrack.deb
----

The following directories are created:

|===
| Directory | Description

| `/opt/ontrack` | Binaries and scripts
| `/usr/lib/ontrack` | Working and <<configuration,configuration>> directory
| `/var/log/ontrack` | Logging directory
|===

Ontrack is installed as a service using `/etc/init.d/ontrack`.

[source,bash]
----
# Starting Ontrack
service ontrack start
# Status of Ontrack
service ontrack status
# Stopping Ontrack
service ontrack stop
----

The optional `/etc/default/ontrack` file can be used to define the
`JAVA_OPTIONS`, for example:

[source]
./etc/default/ontrack
----
JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx2048m
----

[[installation-digitalocean]]
=== Installing at DigitalOcean

Ontrack has scripts which allow an easy installation on
https://www.digitalocean.com[DigitalOcean].

Ontrack itself is deployed there, as a
https://ontrack.nemerosa.net[demonstration installation]. Its deployment is
part of the the continuous delivery pipeline of Ontrack itself.

NOTE: All the examples below are applicable for
      https://ontrack.nemerosa.net[Ontrack @ Ontrack] and must be adapted for
      your own situation.

[[installation-digitalocean-preparation]]
==== Preparation (only once)

Clone the latest version of Ontrack and switch to the version you want to
install:

   git checkout {ontrack-version}

The https://docs.docker.com/machine/[Docker Machine] must be installed.

Edit the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file and add the following information:

[source,bash]
----
# Your DigitalOcean token
digitalOceanAccessToken = xxx
# Name of the Docker Machine to create locally
# It will also be used as the droplet name
productionMachine = ontrack
# Digital Ocean region where to create the droplet
productionRegion = fra1
# Relative location (can be absolute) of the production
# configuration files
productionConf = gradle/env/prod
# Final URL of the production server
# Used for acceptance testing only
productionUrl = https://ontrack.nemerosa.net
----

Create the DigitalOcean droplet:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle productionSetup
----

This creates an `ontrack` Docker Machine. An IP will be assigned to it, and
this is the moment to configure your DNS and/or floating IP if you have a
domain to assign to it.

HINT: You can copy the `~/.docker/machine/machines/ontrack` Docker Machine
      configuration to another host.

Make sure the local `gradle/env/prod` directory (configured as `productionConf`)
contains the following files:

* `ontrack_nemerosa_net.jks` - the Java keystore containing the certificate for the `ontrack.nemerosa.net` name
* `application-prod.yml` with SSH configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  ssl:
    key-alias: server
    key-store: "config/ontrack_nemerosa_net.jks"
    key-store-password: "xxx"
----

NOTE: This must of course be adapted to your own environment!

Configure the environment of the production server:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle  productionEnv
----

This will upload the production configuration files onto the droplet.

[[installation-digitalocean-backup]]
==== Backing up the data (if applicable)

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle productionBackup
----

This will create a `backup-<version>.tgz` file in the `build` directory.

[[installation-digitalocean-restoring]]
==== Restoring data (if needed)

Restore the data using an existing `backup.tgz` file:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle productionRestore -Pbackup=<path/to/backup.tgz>
----

[[installation-digitalocean-installing]]
==== Installing Ontrack

Starts a new version of Ontrack:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle productionUpgrade -PontrackVersion=2.13.7
----

[[installation-digitalocean-tests]]
==== Running tests

In order to validate the installation, you should run:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -b production.gradle productionTest
----

This command relies on the `productionUrl` parameter being correctly configured.

[[installation-digitalocean-logs]]
==== Accessing the logs

Logs can be accessed using Docker commands. If `ontrack` is the name of the
Docker Machine, then:

[source,bash]
----
# Displays the log in real time
docker logs -f `docker-machine config ontrack` ontrack
# Downloads the log in a ontrack.log file
docker logs `docker-machine config ontrack` ontrack > ontrack.log
----

[[installation-dockercloud]]
=== Installing on Docker Cloud

[[installation-sa]]
=== Standalone installation

Ontrack can be downloaded as a JAR and started as a Spring Boot application.

Download the JAR from the
https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/releases[Ontrack release page]

Start it using `java -jar ontrack.jar` with the following options:

* `--spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:/var/ontrack/data/database/data`
* or `--spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:./database/data`
* and any other Java option, like memory settings: `-Xmx2048m`
* or <<configuration,configuration parameter>> like `--server.port=9999`

to specify the location of the H2 database files.

<<configuration,Options>> can also be specified in an `application.yml` file in
the working directory.

For example:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
spring:
   datasource:
      url: "jdbc:h2:/var/ontrack/data/database/data"
----

[[configuration]]
=== Configuration

As a regular http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot application],
Ontrack can be configured using system properties and/or property files and/or
YAML files. See the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-properties-and-configuration[Spring Boot documentation]
for more details.

NOTE: The way to provide a YAML `application.yml` configuration file or
command line arguments will vary
according to the installation (Docker, RPM, etc.). See the corresponding
section above for more details.

For example, to setup the port Ontrack is running on, you can use the
`server.port` property. Using a YAML file:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
server.port=9999
----

or the command line option:

[source,bash]
----
--server.port=9999
----
