Several _branches_ can be attached to a _project_. _Builds_ can be created
within a branch and linked to other builds (same or other branches).

_Promotion levels_ and _validation stamps_ are attached to a _branch_:

* a _promotion level_ is used to define the _promotion_ a given _build_ has
  reached. A _promotion run_ defines this association.
* a _validation stamp_ is used to qualify some tests or other validations
  on a _build_. A _validation run_ defines this association. There can be
  several runs per build and per validation stamp. A run itself has a sequence
  of statuses attached to it: passed, failed, investigated, etc.

_Branches_, _promotion levels_ and _validation stamps_ define the _static
structure_ of a _project_.
