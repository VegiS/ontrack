[[appendix-deprecations-2.16]]
==== Since 2.16

WARNING: Support for custom branch and tags patterns in
         <<usage-subversion,Subversion configurations>> has been **removed**.
         Ontrack now supports only standard Subversion structure:
         `project/trunk`, `project/branches` and `project/tags`. This has
         allowed a better flexibility in the association between builds and
         Subversion locations.

Association between builds and Subversion locations is now configured through
a _build revision link_ at branch level. The previous `buildPath` parameter is
converted automatically to the appropriate <<usage-subversion,type of link>>.
